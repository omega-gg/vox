# Making money on the vox platform

[vox](https://vox.omega.gg/about/instance) is a libertarian platform based on the [Motion Freedom](https://omega.gg/about/MotionFreedom)
principles. However these principles are bound to common sense and should be made secondary if
people end up starving to death. That's why we're not against advertisement per say, as long as
it's done reasonably. The biggest gripe one could have about streaming platforms is not the fact
that advertisement is present but *mandatory*, meaning that these applications or websites
deliberatly work against your best interests as a user.

Here is a few idea on how people can make money by producing [VBML](https://omega.gg/VBML) content
on the vox platform:
- A patreon page linked in the video via a [VideoTag](https://omega.gg/about/VideoTag) (or in the description).
- Affiliate links accessed via a VideoTag in the video (or in the description).
- An advertisement video slice placed inside a VBML multi-track.
- A commercial product placement in the middle of your video content.
- A VideoTag that links to premium content behind a paywall on your own website.
- An interactive video shop that lets you video click on items that you want to purchase.
- A demonstration of an interactive movie that lets you purchase its full version at the end.

Given the nature of the VBML, it's very easy for a content creator to inject a pre-roll or a
mid-rool of any kind, just refer to our documentation about [tracks](https://omega.gg/VBML/track).
However we let you deal with the hosting and traffic measurements of these video slices.

The vox platform enforces curation, if something goes against our values we might end up notifying
you and possibly pulling specific content down. However, you retain final control over your content
and its hosting given the technology surrounding VBML and [Semantic Player(s)](https://omega.gg/about/SemanticPlayer)
are entirely open. Even this very platform could be forked and hosted under your conditions.
However our software will never force users to do something against their will, if one wants to
skip or avoid a video chunk he shall retain the power to do so.
